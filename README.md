   - Find `server_port=7860`
   - Change to `server_port=7861` (or another number)
3. Check if firewall is blocking the port

### Problem: Measurements seem incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Check cable connections are secure
2. Verify measurement range is appropriate
3. For DMM: Increase NPLC for more stable readings
4. For oscilloscope: Adjust vertical scale and trigger level
5. Check probe attenuation matches settings

## Understanding the Interface

### What is a VISA Address?

A VISA address is like a "phone number" for test equipment. It uniquely identifies your instrument.

**Format:** `USB0::VendorID::ProductID::SerialNumber::INSTR`

**Example:** `USB0::0x05E6::0x2230::805224014806770001::INSTR`

- `USB0` = Connection type (USB)
- `0x05E6` = Vendor ID (Keithley/Keysight)
- `0x2230` = Product model
- `805224014806770001` = Unique serial number
- `INSTR` = Instrument type

### What is NPLC?

NPLC (Number of Power Line Cycles) controls measurement integration time:

- **Higher NPLC** = More accurate, slower (averages more samples)
- **Lower NPLC** = Less accurate, faster (takes quick snapshot)

**Recommendations:**
- Lab environment: 1-10 NPLC
- Production testing: 0.1-1 NPLC
- High precision: 10 NPLC

### What is Over-Voltage Protection (OVP)?

OVP is a safety feature that **automatically shuts off** the power supply if voltage exceeds a set threshold. This protects sensitive electronics from damage.

**Example:** If testing a 5V circuit, set OVP to 6V. If voltage accidentally goes above 6V, the supply turns off.

## Data Export and Analysis

### Exporting Data

All interfaces support data export in multiple formats:

1. **CSV** (Comma-Separated Values):
   - Opens in Excel, Google Sheets
   - Easy to analyze and share
   - Best for most users

2. **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation):
   - For programming and automation
   - Structured data format

3. **Excel** (.xlsx):
   - Native Excel format
   - Includes formatting

### Finding Exported Files

Exported files are saved to:
- Power Supply: `voltage_ramp_data/` folder
- DMM: Current working directory
- Oscilloscope: `outputs/` folder

Files are named with timestamps:
- Example: `dmm_data_20250119_143022.csv`
- Format: `instrument_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext`

## Advanced Features

### Automated Voltage Ramping (Power Supply)

Create custom voltage patterns for automated testing:

**Available Waveforms:**
- **Sine Wave**: Smooth up and down curve
- **Square Wave**: Sharp on/off pattern
- **Triangle Wave**: Linear increase and decrease
- **Ramp Up**: Gradual increase from 0 to max
- **Ramp Down**: Gradual decrease from max to 0

**Configuration:**
1. Select waveform type
2. Set target voltage (maximum voltage to reach)
3. Set number of cycles (how many repetitions)
4. Set cycle duration (time for one complete pattern)
5. Click "Start Ramping"

**Use Cases:**
- Battery charging simulations
- Temperature cycling tests
- Device stress testing
- Power-up sequence validation

### Statistical Analysis (DMM)

The Statistics tab provides:

- **Count**: Number of measurements
- **Mean**: Average value
- **Std Dev**: Standard deviation (consistency measure)
- **Min/Max**: Range of values
- **Trend Plot**: Visual representation over time

**Interpreting Results:**
- Low standard deviation = Stable, consistent measurements
- High standard deviation = Noisy or varying signal
- Trend plot shows if signal is drifting over time

## Safety Guidelines

### General Safety

1. **Always start with low voltage/current** and gradually increase
2. **Use appropriate safety equipment** (safety glasses if working with high voltage)
3. **Never exceed equipment ratings** listed in instrument manual
4. **Keep workspace clean and organized**
5. **Turn off outputs before connecting/disconnecting devices**

### Emergency Procedures

**If you see/smell smoke or sparks:**
1. Click "EMERGENCY STOP" immediately
2. Turn off instrument power switch
3. Unplug instrument if safe to do so
4. Do not touch equipment until it cools down
5. Report incident to supervisor

**If measurement seems wrong:**
1. Disable outputs immediately
2. Check all connections
3. Verify settings are appropriate

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Do I need to be a programmer to use this?

**A:** No! The web interface is designed for non-technical users. Just follow the step-by-step instructions above.

### Q: Can multiple people use this at the same time?

**A:** Yes, if they're on the same network. The software shows a network address (like `http://192.168.1.XXX:7860`) that others can access from their browsers. However, only one person should control the instrument at a time to avoid conflicts.

### Q: Will this work on Mac or Linux?

**A:** Yes! Python and the required libraries work on all platforms. However, you may need to adjust file paths (use `/` instead of `\` on Mac/Linux).

### Q: How do I update the software?

**A:** If you received this via Git:
```bash
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

If you received files directly, ask for the latest version from your supervisor.

### Q: What if my instrument model is different?

**A:** This software is designed for specific models (Keithley 2230, DMM6500/7510, Keysight DSOX6004A). Similar models may work but aren't guaranteed. Contact support for compatibility questions.

### Q: Can I run this on multiple instruments simultaneously?

**A:** Yes! You can run multiple instances of the software on different ports:
1. Run first instrument on port 7860
2. Run second instrument - edit script to use port 7861
3. Run third instrument - edit script to use port 7862

Each opens in a different browser tab.

### Q: How long can I keep the software running?

**A:** The software can run continuously. However, it's good practice to:
- Close it when not in use
- Restart periodically (daily/weekly) to clear memory
- Disconnect instruments when finished testing
