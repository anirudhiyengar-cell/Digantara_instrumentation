## Step-by-Step Setup (First Time Only)

### 1. Install Python

**What is Python?** Python is a programming language. This software needs Python to run, but you don't need to know how to program.

#### Windows Users:

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Click the big yellow "Download Python" button
3. Run the downloaded file
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Wait for installation to complete (2-3 minutes)
7. Click "Close"

#### Mac Users:

1. Open Terminal (search "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. Copy and paste this command:
   ```bash
   brew install python3
   ```
   (If you don't have Homebrew, visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) first)

#### Linux Users:

Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

---

### 2. Download/Locate This Software

If you haven't already, you should have this folder on your computer:
```
Digantara_instrumentation/
```

**Remember this location!** You'll need it in the next step.

Example locations:
- Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\Digantara_instrumentation`
- Mac: `/Users/YourName/Desktop/Digantara_instrumentation`
- Linux: `/home/yourname/Desktop/Digantara_instrumentation`

### 3. Install Required Software

#### Windows:

1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. A black window appears (Command Prompt)
4. Type this command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   cd "path\to\Digantara_instrumentation"
   ```
   **Replace** `path\to\Digantara_instrumentation` with the actual location from Step 2

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\JohnDoe\Desktop\Digantara_instrumentation"
   ```

5. Now type this command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Wait 2-5 minutes while it downloads and installs components
7. You should see "Successfully installed..." messages

#### Mac/Linux:

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/Digantara_instrumentation
   ```
   (Adjust path if your folder is elsewhere)

3. Run installation:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Wait for completion

### 4. Install VISA Drivers (Communication with Instruments)

**What is VISA?** It's software that lets your computer talk to lab instruments via USB.

#### All Users:

1. Go to [ni.com/visa](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-visa.html)
2. Click "Download" for your operating system
3. Run the downloaded installer

## Using the Interface - Power Supply Example

### Connecting to Your Power Supply

1. **Find the VISA Address**:
   - It should be pre-filled in the text box
   - Looks like: `USB0::0x05E6::0x2230::SERIAL::INSTR`
   - If empty, click "Scan for Instruments" (if available) or check instrument label

2. **Click "Connect"**:
   - Wait 2-3 seconds
   - Status should change to "Connected"
   - You'll see instrument information displayed

### Setting Up an Output

Let's say you want to output **5 Volts** on **Channel 1**:

1. **Go to the Channel 1 Tab**:
   - Click on "Channel 1" at the top

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - **Voltage (V)**: Move slider to `5.0`
   - **Current Limit (A)**: Set to `0.5` (safety limit - adjust as needed)
   - **OVP (V)**: Set to `6.0` (overvoltage protection - slightly above your voltage)

3. **Apply Configuration**:
   - Click "Configure Ch1" button
   - Wait for "Configuration successful" message

4. **Enable the Output**:
   - Click "Enable Output" button
   - Status changes to "ON"
   - **Your device now has power!**

5. **Check the Output**:
   - Click "Measure" button
   - You should see:
     - **Measured Voltage**: ~5.000 V
     - **Measured Current**: (depends on your load)
     - **Measured Power**: (Voltage × Current)

6. **Turn Off When Done**:
   - Click "Disable Output" button
   - Status changes to "OFF"

### Safety Tip
Always use the **Current Limit** feature! Set it to the maximum current your device should ever draw. This prevents damage if something goes wrong.

## Using the Interface - Digital Multimeter Example

### Measuring DC Voltage

Let's measure a DC voltage (like a battery):

1. **Connect to DMM**:
   - Enter VISA address (usually pre-filled)
   - Click "Connect"
   - Wait for "Connected" status

2. **Configure Measurement**:
   - **Measurement Function**: Select "DC_VOLTAGE" from dropdown
   - **Range**: Set to `10.0` (for voltages up to 10V)
     - If measuring 12V battery, use `100` range
   - **NPLC**: Leave at `1.0` (good balance of speed and accuracy)
   - **Auto Zero**: Keep checked ✓

3. **Connect Test Leads**:
   - Red probe to HI terminal
   - Black probe to LO terminal
   - Connect to device you're measuring

4. **Take Measurement**:
   - Click "Single Measurement"
   - Result appears in "Current Reading" box
   - Example: `5.234 V`

5. **Continuous Measurements**:
   - If you want ongoing measurements:
   - Set "Interval (seconds)" to `1.0` (one reading per second)
   - Click "Start Continuous"
   - Click "Stop Continuous" when done

6. **View Statistics**:
   - Go to "Statistics & Analysis" tab
   - Set "Number of Points" to `100`
   - Click "Calculate Statistics"
   - See average, min, max, standard deviation

7. **Export Your Data**:
   - Go to "Data Export" tab
   - Choose format: "CSV" (for Excel)
   - Click "Export Data"
   - File saves to project folder
